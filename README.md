# restaurant 
Implemented a computerized system for managing restaurants - in linked lists.
The restaurant has two components: a kitchen that creates dishes and a dining room.

->The first input comes from a file, which contains
Sequence of orders to be done in a restaurant, for example: ordering a dish, canceling a dish, closing a table, etc.
 
->Each line in this file will represent an action in a restaurant:
The first character in the row will be a 5-1 number that represents the serial number of the function to be run.

->The second input comes from an input file that contains the details of the dishes that will be fed into the kitchen when the restaurant opens.
